#Covid-19 Stochastic R Project

This project models the progression of COVID-19 through various health states in patients using stochastic methods. The focus is on understanding the probabilistic transitions between states such as healthy, infected, recovered, and deceased using stochastic matrix computations.

## Project Objective

To simulate and analyze the state transitions of individuals affected by COVID-19 using stochastic modeling techniques, specifically employing **S (state) matrices** and **F (transition) matrices**.

## Methodology

- **Stochastic Modeling**: The model assumes that a patient's COVID-19 progression follows a stochastic process.
- **S Matrix**: Represents the initial state distribution of the population.
- **F Matrix**: Defines the transition probabilities between health states.
- **Iterative Simulation**: The simulation uses matrix multiplication to project the future state distribution over several days.

## Output

The model outputs:
- The **conditional probabilities** of being in each health state after a certain number of days.
- Numerical results and visualizations illustrating how the population shifts between states over time.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have R and the following libraries installed:
